## How To customize it

### First, Edit the txt file
- Remove or add the item in the item.txt (make sure they line up)
- Remove or add the item unit in the itemUnit.txt (make sure they line up)
- Now change the number in itemPrice.txt (try to make it x.xx so it looks like money format)
- Last, change the amount in itemAmount.txt to make sure it is 



### Next, run the code
#### Tips:
- After the first run, check the .txt file; there might be an issue with your edited txt file.
- the preview should be printed in the terminal/cmd but might not be the same as the txt file printed.
